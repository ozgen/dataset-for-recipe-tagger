Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt.
Meanwhile, cook sausage in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until crumbled and no longer pink, stirring occasionally; drain. Add undrained tomatoes and tomato paste; mix well. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer sausage mixture to medium bowl; set aside.
Drain pasta in colander. Place half of pasta in same skillet; top with half each of the sausage mixture and cheese. Repeat all layers. Cover skillet with lid. Place over medium heat; cook 5 minutes or until all layers are hot and cheese melts. Remove from heat; let stand 1 minute before serving.
