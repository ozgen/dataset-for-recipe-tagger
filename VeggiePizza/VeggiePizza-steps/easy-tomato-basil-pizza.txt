Mix the tomatoes and salt in a mesh strainer. Let mixture sit and drain for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine the drained tomatoes, 8 ounces of mozzarella cheese, onion, basil, pepper, olive oil, jalapenos, olives, and mushrooms in a bowl. Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza crusts. Distribute tomato mixture over the two pizza crusts evenly.  Sprinkle 8 ounces of mozzarella cheese and the Parmesan cheese over both pizzas.
Bake pizzas in preheated oven until cheese is completely melted, 8 to 10 minutes.
