In a large bowl, mix together the flour, eggs, water and salt. It will be very watery, as the pizza is like a crepe. Stir in the crabmeat, pork, tofu, bean sprouts, mixed vegetables, and cabbage until well blended.
Heat some of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Your pizzas will be the size of your skillet. Spoon in enough of the vegetable batter to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the underside is golden brown. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. The edges should be crispy. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve pizzas with dipping sauce.
To make the dipping sauce, mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and chile pepper in a sealable container. Seal, and shake until well blended. Shake again just before serving.
