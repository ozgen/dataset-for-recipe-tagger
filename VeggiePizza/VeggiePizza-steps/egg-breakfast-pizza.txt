Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Place pizza crusts upside down on cookie sheets and bake for 5 to 7 minutes. Do not allow to brown.
Beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Scramble eggs until firm.
Remove crusts from oven, turn right side up, spread 1/2 can of cream of celery soup on top of each crust.  Spread 1/2 of egg mixture on each crust. Sprinkle bacon bits on one pizza and cooked sausage on the other. Cover each with onions and peppers.  Top each pizza with 2 cups of cheese.
Bake in preheated oven, for 25 to 30 minutes, until cheese is golden brown.
