Pizza dough: Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and knead the dough for 5 minutes. Let it rest for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 4 equally sized balls. Let balls rest for 30 minutes, then flatten each with a rolling pin and place on an oven tray.
Leek Fondue with Maille® Honey Dijon mustard: Slice the leek as thinly as possible and wash it. Melt the butter in a sauce pan then add the sliced leek. Cook the leek gently for 10 minutes.

Vegetables: Boil potatoes until tender. Peel and cut the potatoes in thin slices. Sprinkle on Parmesan cheese. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half.
Assembly: Cover the flattened pizza dough with the Maille® Honey Dijon mustard leek fondue. Top with the slices of potatoes and sliced cherry tomatoes. Cook the pizzas at 430 degrees F for 8 minutes. Top with a few leaves of arugula and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Serve hot.
