Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes; drain.
In a large bowl combine potatoes, broccoli, cheese, lemon juice, garlic, basil, oregano and parsley.  On a pizza pan or baking sheet, roll out 1 pizza dough.  Top with potato mixture and cover with second pizza dough; with moistened fingers seal edges of dough together.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.   Serve with warmed pizza sauce.
