Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, honey, ketchup, soy sauce, and hot sauce. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until onion is tender.
In a bowl, mix the onion mixture with the ground beef. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (70 degrees C).
