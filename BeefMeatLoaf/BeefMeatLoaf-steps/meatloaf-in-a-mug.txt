Place the torn bread into a small bowl, and pour in the milk and Worcestershire sauce; set aside for a few minutes for the bread to absorb the liquid. Add the ground beef, green onion, seasoned salt, and pepper to the bread; mix well and place into a 10 ounce, microwave-safe mug.
Cook in the microwave at 70 percent power until the meatloaf is firm and no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 1/2 minutes depending on the microwave. Remove the meatloaf from the microwave, and allow to stand 2 minutes before serving.
