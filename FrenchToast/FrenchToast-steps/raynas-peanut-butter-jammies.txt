Spread four slices of bread with peanut butter and jam. Cover with remaining four slices of bread. Beat together egg, milk, sugar and salt.
In a large skillet or frying pan, melt butter over medium heat.
Dip each sandwich into the egg mixture to coat it well and allow the excess to drip off. Place sandwiches in pan and cook until golden on both sides. Serve warm.
