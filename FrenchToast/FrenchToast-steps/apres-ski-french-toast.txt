Place bread in a flat bottomed dish. Whisk together the eggs, milk, orange juice, orange zest, vanilla, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a mixing bowl.  Pour egg mixture over bread, and refrigerate until bread absorbs the liquid, about 10 minutes.
Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Place bread into skillet.  Cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side.
