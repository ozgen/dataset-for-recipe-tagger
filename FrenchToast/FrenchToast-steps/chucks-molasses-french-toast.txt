Beat together the eggs, molasses, cream, vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl until smooth. Dip the challah slices in the batter until coated on all sides.
Melt half of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place half of the challah slices into the pan, and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining butter and challah slices.
