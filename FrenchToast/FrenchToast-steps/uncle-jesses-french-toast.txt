In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves.
Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip slices of bread one at a time into the egg, quickly coating each side but not fully saturating the bread.
Fry a few slices at a time in the buttered skillet until golden brown on each side. Add more butter to the skillet and continue with remaining slices.  Melt remaining butter in the microwave at 15 second intervals. Place finished toast onto plates, drizzle with melted butter, and dust with confectioners' sugar.
