Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly oil a 9x5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray.
Whisk together the egg whites, sugar, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and almond extract in a small bowl; mix until well blended.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and baking soda.
Mix the egg into the flour; stir until well blended.
Fold in the walnuts, raisins, carrot, and drained pineapple.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (but not necessarily dry), about 40 minutes.
Set aside to cool for 10 to 20 minutes before refrigerating overnight.
