Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.
Beat the oil and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl.
Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the oil mixture before adding the next.
Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; beat into the wet mixture.
Fold grated carrots through the batter, mixing just enough to evenly combine.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
