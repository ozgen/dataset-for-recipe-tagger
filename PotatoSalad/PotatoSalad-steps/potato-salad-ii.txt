Place potatoes in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Add 2 teaspoons salt.  Bring to a boil; cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain, and allow to cool until easily handled but still warm.
Cut potatoes into bite size pieces, and transfer to a medium mixing bowl.  Add salad dressing, and gently stir until well coated.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Serve warm.
