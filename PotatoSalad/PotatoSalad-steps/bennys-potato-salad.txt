Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 5 minutes, until tender but not mushy. Drain in a colander, and run under cold water to cool. Set aside.
In a large serving bowl, Stir together the eggs, green olives, dill and sweet pickle relishes, green onion, mayonnaise, yellow and brown mustards, and wine vinegar. Season with garlic powder, black pepper, white pepper, salt, celery seed, dill seed, and dill. Mix well, and stir in potatoes until coated. Chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.
