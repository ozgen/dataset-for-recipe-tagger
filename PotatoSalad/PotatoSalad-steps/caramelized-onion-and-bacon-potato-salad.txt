Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until softened and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Add tarragon; pour in white wine to deglaze pan. Simmer until wine evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.
