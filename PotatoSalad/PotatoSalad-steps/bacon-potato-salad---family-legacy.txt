Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove skin from potatoes; quarter and slice.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Combine potatoes, bacon, onion, celery, and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, milk, sour cream, vinegar, celery salt, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl. Fold mayonnaise mixture into potato mixture until incorporated. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight to allow flavors to blend.
