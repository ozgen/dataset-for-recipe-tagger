Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and slice.
In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, olive oil, garlic, dill pickle relish and onion. Mix and cover with sliced potatoes.
Whisk together mayonnaise, pepper, sour cream and parsley. Pour over potatoes and chill at least 8 hours.
