Scrub potatoes and cut in half or quarters, if larger. In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat; season water with salt. Reduce heat and boil gently for about 15 min or until potatoes are tender. Drain and transfer to a large bowl; let cool slightly.
Meanwhile, make Dressing: in a blender, combine cream, garlic, mustard, salt and pepper; puree until smooth. With motor running, pour in lemon juice. Add yogurt and pulse to blend. Let stand for 5 min or until thickened.
Add half of the Parmesan cheese and bacon (if using) to potatoes and pour in dressing; toss gently to coat. Just before serving, add lettuce and toss to combine. Divide among serving bowls and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan.
