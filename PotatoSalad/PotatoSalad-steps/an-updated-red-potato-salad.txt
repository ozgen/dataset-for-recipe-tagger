Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cube potatoes.
Transfer potatoes to a large bowl; stir in mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, sugar, onion, and celery seed until well coated. Gently mix in eggs and season with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate until chilled.
