Place potatoes in a large saucepan or Dutch oven, and cover with lightly salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender; drain and cool. Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/4 inch slices.
Mix together the potatoes, cucumbers, and mayonnaise; season with salt and pepper.
