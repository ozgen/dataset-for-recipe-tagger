Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Allow to cool.
Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water and cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel once cold. Dice the eggs.
In a salad bowl, lightly toss the potatoes, eggs, artichoke hearts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, croutons, Dijon mustard, rice vinegar, and mayonnaise until all ingredients are coated with dressing.
