Boil potatoes until soft, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove potatoes to a large bowl.
While the potatoes are still warm but not steaming, stir in the hard-cooked eggs with a fork. Mix in the dill pickle, then stir in the mayonnaise. Season to taste with salt. Continue to stir until potatoes are smashed and not many big chunks remain.
