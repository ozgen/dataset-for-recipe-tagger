Peel the potatoes and add to a large pot of boiling salted water. Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and cube.  Place into a large bowl and set aside.
In a double boiler, bring vinegar to a boil.  Gradually beat in eggs and cook over simmering water until thickened.  Stir in butter and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in cream, parsley, onion, mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne.  Pour over hot potatoes and combine.  Cool, sprinkle with parsley and refrigerate until serving time.
