Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl.  Cool slightly.  Peel and slice into a large bowl.
In a small bowl, combine oil, vinegar, consomme, green onion, parsley, and salt and pepper.
Gently toss warm potatoes with dressing.  Cover, and refrigerate several hours or overnight.
