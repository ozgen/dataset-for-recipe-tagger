In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp.  Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon of bacon grease.
Place bacon grease in a large stock pot over medium heat.  Cook bell pepper, onion and celery leaves in grease until just tender.  Stir in bacon, corn and water and bring slowly to a boil, stirring frequently.  Stir in milk and heat gently, without boiling.  Serve hot.
