In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.  Cook celery, onion and carrot in butter until onion begins to soften.  Stir in garlic, oregano, salt and pepper and cook 2 minutes more.  Stir in corn, chicken broth, cooked chicken and chile pepper and let simmer until heated through.  Stir in milk and heat gently just before serving.
