Melt margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef strips, and fry until browned. Stir in onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until softened. Sprinkle flour over the meat, and stir into the pan juices until blended. Gradually mix in the beef broth, Burgundy, tomato paste and thyme. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 40 to 45 minutes.
During the last 15 minutes of the cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes.
Remove the burgundy beef from the heat and stir in sour cream. Serve over hot egg noodles.
