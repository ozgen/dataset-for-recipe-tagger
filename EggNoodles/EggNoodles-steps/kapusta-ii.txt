Place the salt pork in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently until the fat has melted down and the meaty parts are cooked. Add shredded cabbage, and cook over medium-low heat until tender, stirring to coat the cabbage with the salt pork drippings.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain. When the cabbage has cooked completely, stir egg noodles into the cabbage, and season with black pepper to taste.
