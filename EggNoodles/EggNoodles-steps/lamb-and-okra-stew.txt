Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook until transparent. Add the cubed lamb, and cook until browned on all sides. Season with cumin, mint, turmeric and rosemary. Cook for another 5 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste and okra. Combine the lemon juice and water, and stir into the skillet. Cover, and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the egg noodles, and saute until toasted. Pour in the chicken broth and water, and bring to a boil. Stir in rice, cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in olive oil before serving. Serve the lamb stew over the rice pilaf.
