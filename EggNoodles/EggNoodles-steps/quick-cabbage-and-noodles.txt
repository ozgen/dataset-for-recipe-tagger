Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until ground beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Cook and stir cabbage into ground beef mixture until cabbage is just tender, about 5 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
Stir noodles and cream of mushroom soup into the beef and cabbage until heated through; season with salt and black pepper.
