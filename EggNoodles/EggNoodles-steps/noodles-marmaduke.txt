Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic and mushrooms; cook and stir until lightly browned. Crumble in the ground beef, and cook until no longer pink. Drain excess grease.
Stir in the Burgundy wine, scraping any bits of food from the bottom of the pan to flavor the sauce. Then stir in the lemon juice, beef consomme, salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.
Mix the uncooked noodles into the skillet. Cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, or until noodles are tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Sprinkle parsley over the top and serve.
