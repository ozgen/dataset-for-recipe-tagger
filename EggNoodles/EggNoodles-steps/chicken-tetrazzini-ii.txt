Boil chicken breasts and celery in 4 cups of water for about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and remove chicken from water to cool. When chicken is cooled, shred and set aside.
In a large skillet, melt butter or margarine. Drain mushrooms, reserving liquid, and add to skillet. Heat thoroughly, seasoning with salt and pepper. Add evaporated milk, reserved mushroom liquid and sherry, stirring well. Add cheese a few slices at a time until thoroughly melted and blended. Add shredded chicken and bring to a slow boil.
