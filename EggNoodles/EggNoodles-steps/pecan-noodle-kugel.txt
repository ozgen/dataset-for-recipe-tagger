Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Beat in half of the melted butter, then stir in half of the brown sugar and a pinch of salt. Stir in the noodles, making sure the noodles are evenly coated. Spread the remaining butter on the bottom of a deep baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar in the baking dish, patting the sugar up the sides. Spread pecans over the brown sugar. Pour noodle mixture over the sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Run a paring knife between the kugel and the edge of the baking dish. Hold the pan on its side and gently tap the sides of the pan against the counter to loosen it. Cover the baking dish with a large platter and invert it to tip the kugel out of the baking dish and onto the plate.
