Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place cooked egg noodles in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Add cheese, mushrooms and celery and mix well; pour in chicken stock. (Note: If level of chicken stock cannot be seen through noodles, add more until it can.) Place chicken breasts on top of noodle mixture, bone side down.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until skin is brown and crisp and chicken juices run clear.
