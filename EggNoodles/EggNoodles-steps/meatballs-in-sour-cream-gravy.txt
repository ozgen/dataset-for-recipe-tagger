Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place egg noodles in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
In a bowl, mix the beef, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, pepper, eggs, and onion. Form into small meatballs around the olives.
Heat the oil in skillet over medium heat, and cook the meatballs until evenly brown. Remove meatballs from skillet, reserving oil; set meatballs aside, and keep warm.
Stir the flour into the reserved oil in the skillet. Gradually mix in water to form a thick gravy. Stir in sour cream, dill, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cook until heated through. Pour over the meatballs, and serve over cooked egg noodles.
