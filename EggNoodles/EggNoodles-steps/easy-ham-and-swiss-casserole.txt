Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Combine the cream of mushroom soup, white wine, and water in a large bowl. Stir in the cooked egg noodles, ham, and Swiss cheese. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the dry stuffing mix over the dish.  Bake uncovered until the casserole is bubbling and browned, about 30 minutes.
