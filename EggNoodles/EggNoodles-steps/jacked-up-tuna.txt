Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles, and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain.
While the noodles are cooking, mix together the sour cream, milk, garlic and salt; taste and adjust seasoning if desired. Stir into drained noodles along with peas and tuna. Heat through over low heat, and serve.
