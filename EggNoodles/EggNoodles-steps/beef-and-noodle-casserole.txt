Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook the noodles according to package directions.
Brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium high heat. Stir in the tomato soup, Worcestershire sauce and garlic, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and let simmer.
When noodles are done, stir them and the cheese into the simmering sauce until cheese is melted.  Stir the sherry into the sauce and stir for 1 minute, then place in a 2 quart casserole dish and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese to taste.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
