Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl.
Add mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and onion to the noodles; mix well.  Stir in green pepper, crab, shrimp and celery. Salt and pepper to taste. Spoon mixture into an 8x8 inch casserole dish. Sprinkle bread crumbs to taste over the casserole.
Bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until brown and bubbly.
