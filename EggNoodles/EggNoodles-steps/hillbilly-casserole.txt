Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the tomato soup, corn, onion, and cream of mushroom soup. Stir in the cooked noodles until well coated. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place slices of cheese to cover the top.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
