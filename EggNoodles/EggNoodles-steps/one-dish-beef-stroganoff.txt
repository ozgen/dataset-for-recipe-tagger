Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion, garlic and parsley and cook until the onion is tender-crisp.
Stir the broth and mushrooms in the skillet and heat to a boil. Stir in the noodles. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the noodles are tender.
Stir the sour cream in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot. Garnish with the parsley.
