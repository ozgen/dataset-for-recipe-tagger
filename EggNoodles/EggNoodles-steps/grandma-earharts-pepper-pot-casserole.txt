Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the vegetable oil with butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion, celery, and green pepper until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Mix in the pork sausage, and cook until the meat is browned, breaking it up into crumbles as it cooks, about 8 more minutes. Drain off excess grease. Stir in the tomatoes, garlic powder, basil, sage, and Worcestershire sauce, mixing until well combined.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Mix the noodles gently into the pork mixture, and place into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Sprinkle the top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling and browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
