Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl combine the soup, milk, onion and mustard. Mix well and set aside.
Spread sauerkraut into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with uncooked noodles, then spoon soup mixture evenly over noodles. Cover all with sausage and top with cheese. Lastly, combine bread crumbs and melted butter in a small bowl and mix together; sprinkle mixture over cheese.
Cover baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until noodles are tender.
