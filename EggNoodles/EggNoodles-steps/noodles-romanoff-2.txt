Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
While noodles are cooking, combine the sour cream, 1/4 cup cheese, chives, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Mix together.
Stir butter into drained noodles, then stir in sour cream mixture. Place on a warm platter and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese.
