Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Immediately add sour cream and cottage cheese to pasta; mix together.
Add Worcestershire sauce, onion and garlic to mixture, if desired. Pour mixture into a lightly greased two-quart baking dish and top with bread crumbs. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
