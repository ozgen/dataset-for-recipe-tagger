Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add kohlrabi, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the kohlrabi is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the drained egg noodles into the kohlrabi; cook and stir until the noodles are slightly fried, 5 to 7 minutes.
