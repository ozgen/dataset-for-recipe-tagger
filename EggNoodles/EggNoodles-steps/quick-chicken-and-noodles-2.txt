Season the chicken with the garlic powder and paprika.  Cook the chicken in a 12 inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned on both sides.
Add the stock, basil, black pepper and vegetables to the skillet and heat to a boil. Stir in the noodles. Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the noodles are tender.
