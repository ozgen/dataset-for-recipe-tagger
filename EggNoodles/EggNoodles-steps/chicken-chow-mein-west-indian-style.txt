Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chile peppers, onion, garlic, and ginger; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 5 tablespoons dark soy sauce; fry for 1 more minute.
Cook and stir chicken in the onion mixture over high heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Add green bell pepper and carrots and cook until softened, about 5 more minutes.
Gently fold noodles into chicken mixture. Mix in white pepper, 5 more tablespoons dark soy sauce, and cilantro until heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with green onion to serve.
