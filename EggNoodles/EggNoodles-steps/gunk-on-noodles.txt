Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place the egg noodles in the pot, cook 6 to 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef 10 minutes, or until evenly brown. Mix in the onion and garlic, and cook until onion is tender. Mix in the tomato paste, mushrooms and juice, sugar, butter, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes, until bubbly and heated through. Serve over the cooked noodles.
