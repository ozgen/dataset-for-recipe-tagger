Cook noodles al dente.  Drain and rinse.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, mix together cottage cheese, sour cream, parmesan, 1 egg, 1 cup cheddar cheese, Worcestershire sauce, milk, butter or margarine, and salt and pepper.   Stir in cooked noodles.  Spread into a 9 inch square baking dish, top with remaining shredded cheese.
Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for one hour, or until set.
