Bring the wild  rice and chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender but not mushy, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, fluff the rice with a fork, and cook uncovered 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and let the rice cool thoroughly in refrigerator, about 1 hour.
Transfer wild rice to a large salad bowl and toss with cooked chicken, grapes, cashews, and water chestnuts. Whisk mayonnaise, seasoned salt, soy sauce, and curry powder in a separate bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss again. Chill thoroughly, at least 1 hour or overnight for best flavor.
