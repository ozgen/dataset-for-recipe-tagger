Combine all dressing ingredients; stir until well blended. Add turkey or chicken, apples, celery and raisins. Toss to coat the salad ingredients. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired.
Place lettuce leaf on each of 6 serving plates. Top each with mound of salad.  Garnish each salad with chopped fresh parsley or chives.
Deli turkey breast may be used in the recipe. Ask the deli to slice the turkey into 3/4- or 1-inch slices, then cube the meat at home before adding to this salad.
