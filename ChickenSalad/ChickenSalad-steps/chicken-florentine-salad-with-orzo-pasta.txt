Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Mix orzo, spinach, chicken, tomatoes, pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes, and capers in a large bowl.
Whisk balsamic vinegar, olive oil, sugar, parsley, basil, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; drizzle over salad. Toss to coat. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over salad.
