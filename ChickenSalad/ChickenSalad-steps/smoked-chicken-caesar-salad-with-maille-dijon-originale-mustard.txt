Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes and toss in the sunflower oil, salt and pepper. Spread onto a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, until crispy and golden. Remove from the oven to cool.
Place the egg, garlic, anchovy fillets, MailleÂ® Dijon Originale mustard and vinegar into a food processor. Blend for 30 seconds, before slowly adding the olive oil. When all of the oil is added, the dressing should be slightly thickened.
Toss the roughly torn lettuce leaves in a mixing bowl, with the dressing, making sure that all of the leaves are coated. Arrange leaves on a serving platter, top with the slices of smoked chicken breast, croutons and Parmesan cheese.
