Using a medium skillet coated with pan spray, brown the sweet apple chicken sausages over medium high heat.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add red quinoa stir in.  Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until quinoa is tender, 10 Â– 15 minutes.  Quinoa should be crunchy.  Strain and chill with cold water, drain well. Transfer to a mixing bowl, and toss in the beets, orange peel, red onion, red pepper and fresh mint.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, pomegranate juice, olive oil, honey, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper. Pour over the salad mixture and mix well.
Slice the browned sweet apple chicken sausage 1/4 inch on the diagonal, and toss with the quinoa salad. Chill or serve immediately
Arrange with the orange slices and garnish with fresh mint.
