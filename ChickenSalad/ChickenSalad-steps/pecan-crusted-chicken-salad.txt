Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the creamy garlic dressing and pecans in separate bowls. Dip each chicken breast in the dressing then in the pecans to coat. Arrange chicken on a baking sheet.
Bake chicken 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until juices run clear. Cool slightly, and cut into strips.
On serving plates, arrange equal amounts of the lettuce, mandarin oranges, cranberries, and blue cheese. Top with equal amounts chicken, and serve with Ranch dressing.
