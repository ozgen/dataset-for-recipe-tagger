Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, add broccoli a few minutes before pasta is done; drain.
Cook the chicken in a pan, seasoning with lemon pepper as it cooks. When the chicken is no longer pink inside, cut into small pieces. Combine chicken to pasta-broccoli mixture. Stir in oil and sliced green onion and add lemon pepper to taste.
