Place cooking wine and chicken in large saucepan. Add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer 10 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer pink.
Let chicken cool in liquid 45 minutes. Drain; cut chicken into bite-sized pieces.
In large bowl, combine chicken, pea pods, celery, onions, mayonnaise, lemon peel and pepper; mix well. Cover; refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to blend flavors.
Just before serving, stir in almonds. To serve, spoon chicken salad onto lettuce-lined plates.
