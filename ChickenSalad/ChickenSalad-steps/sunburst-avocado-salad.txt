Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Spray both sides of the tortillas with the cooking spray.  Line 4 (7-inch) oven-safe bowls with 1 tortilla each.  Place the bowls onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes or until the tortillas are golden brown and crisp.  Let the tortillas cool in the bowls on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  Remove the tortillas from the bowls and let cool completely on a wire rack.
Stir the salsa and vegetable oil in a small bowl.  Stir the chicken and half the salsa mixture in a medium bowl.  Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes.  Stir in the grapefruit, avocado and pecans.
Divide the greens among the tortillas.  Top with the chicken mixture.  Drizzle with the remaining salsa mixture.
