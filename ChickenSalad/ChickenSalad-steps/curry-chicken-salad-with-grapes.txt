Heat butter in a large saucepan over low heat until melted; remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
Stir mayonnaise, garlic, parsley, and curry powder into butter until evenly incorporated. Fold in chicken, grapes, and almonds. Transfer mixture to a serving bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until flavors have blended, at least 1 hour.
