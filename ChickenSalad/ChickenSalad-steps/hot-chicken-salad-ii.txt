Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small skillet, saute the mushrooms in oil.
Mix together the chicken, mayonnaise, soup, sauteed mushrooms, water chestnuts and celery. Place mixture in a 12x7.5 inch casserole dish. Top with the crushed crackers, tossed with melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes.
