Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water.
Combine chicken, cherries, celery, almonds, and pasta together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, confectioners' sugar, water, vinegar, poppy seeds, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; fold dressing into chicken-pasta mixture.
