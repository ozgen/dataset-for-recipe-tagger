In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and poppy seeds, and set aside.  Wash lettuce and tear into bite-sized pieces.  To a large bowl, first add the lettuce, then the onions, water chestnuts, and chicken.  Just before serving, top with the almonds, noodles and dressing, and toss lightly.
