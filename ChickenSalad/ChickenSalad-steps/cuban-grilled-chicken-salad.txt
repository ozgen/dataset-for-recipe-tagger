Toss the romaine with the onion, avocado, and peppers in a large bowl.  Divide among four salad plates.  Top each salad with a mound of black beans, some pineapple chunks, and the chopped chicken meat.
Whisk together the olive oil with the garlic, salt, and pepper.  Drizzle this dressing over each salad along with a little lime juice.
