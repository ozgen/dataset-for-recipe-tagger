Rub the Cajun seasoning into the pork shoulder; place in the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour the pepperoncini with the juice, and the adobo sauce over the pork. Top with the onion, garlic, and cilantro. Pour enough water into the slow cooker to cover the bottom half of the pork shoulder.
Cook on Low until the meat begins to fall apart, 6 to 8 hours. Shred meat with two forks inside the slow cooker before serving.
