In a bowl, mix the wine, white pepper, liquid smoke, garlic, black pepper, pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Place pork in a slow cooker, and cover with the sauce mixture. Cover, and cook 4 to 5 hours on Low, or until the meat shreds easily.
Shred the pork with a fork. Mix in the barbeque sauce, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper. Continue cooking 30 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
Place pork in a strainer to remove excess liquid, pushing down with a large spoon to extract as much moisture as possible. Liquid may be reserved as a dipping sauce.
