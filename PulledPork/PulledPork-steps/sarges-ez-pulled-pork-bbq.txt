Cut roast in half. Rub each half with salt and pepper, and place in the slow cooker. Pour broth and coffee over the meat.
Turn the slow cooker to Low, and cover. Cook  for 6 to 8 hours, or until the roast is fork tender.
Carefully remove the roast to a cutting board. Pull the meat off the bone with a fork. You may also chop it with a cleaver afterwards, if you like it really finely cut.
