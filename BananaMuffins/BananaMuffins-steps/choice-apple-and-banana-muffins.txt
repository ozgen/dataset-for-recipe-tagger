Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl, stir together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir in milk, banana, apples, orange zest and vanilla extract. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Check bake time by inserting a toothpick into the center of a muffin. The muffins are done when the toothpick comes out clean.
While muffins bake, combine 1/4 cup white sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a small saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Brush glaze over baked muffins, then sprinkle muffins with as much cinnamon as you like.
