Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix mashed bananas and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Add eggs, olive oil, and vanilla extract; mix well.
Mix flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into batter. Distribute batter into the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
