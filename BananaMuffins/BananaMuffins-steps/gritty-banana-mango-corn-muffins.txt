Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk together the cornmeal, couscous, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir in the dried mango.
Whisk together the mashed bananas, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and buttermilk. Stir the cornmeal mixture into the banana mixture, and let the batter rest until the couscous absorbs some of the moisture, about 5 minutes. Spoon the batter into ungreased muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing. Serve warm or at room temperature.
