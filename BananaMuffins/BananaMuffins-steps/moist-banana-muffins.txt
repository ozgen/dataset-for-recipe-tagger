Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Stir the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and sugar together in a bowl. Add the bananas, mayonnaise, and chocolate chips; stir until well combined. Pour into prepared muffin cups to about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes.
