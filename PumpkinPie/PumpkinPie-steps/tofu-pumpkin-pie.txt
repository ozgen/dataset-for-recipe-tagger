Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the tofu, pumpkin, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and clove into a blender. Puree until smooth. Pour into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking until a knife inserted into the mixture comes out clean, about 40 minutes more. Cool before serving.
