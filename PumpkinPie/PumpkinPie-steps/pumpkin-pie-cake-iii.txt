Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.
Whisk the pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, and pumpkin pie space together in a bowl. Pour into the prepared pan. Scatter the cake mix over the top of the pumpkin mixture; sprinkle the nuts over the cake mix. Drizzle the melted butter over the entire cake.
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the center, about 50 minutes.
