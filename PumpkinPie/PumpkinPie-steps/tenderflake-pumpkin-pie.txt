MIX together flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in lard with a pastry cutter or gently with finger tips until mixture resembles coarse oatmeal. Gradually add enough water to make dough cling together. Gather into a ball and divide in half. Shape each ball into a flattened round on a lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate one for 30 minutes and freeze one for later use.
PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
ROLL out one pastry round on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin until slightly larger than an upside down 9-inch (23cm) pie plate. Transfer into pie plate. Flute edges with floured fork or fingers. Place on a baking sheet.
WHISK eggs and yolks together in a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients and stir to combine. Pour into pie shell and cover fluted pastry edge with aluminum foil to prevent over browning.
BAKE in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil from edge and bake an additional 20-25 minutes or until filling in center is set.
