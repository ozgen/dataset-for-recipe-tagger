Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix brown sugar, ground ginger, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a large bowl; add pumpkin and eggs. Beat the pumpkin mixture until smooth. Stir evaporated milk into the pumpkin mixture; pour into the pie crust.
Bake in preheated oven until the pie is set in the middle, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature before serving.
