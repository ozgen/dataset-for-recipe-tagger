Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; lightly oil the foil.
Arrange pumpkin halves onto the prepared baking sheet, cut sides down.
Bake in preheated oven until flesh is tender throughout, about 40 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle.
Increase oven heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Scrape pumpkin flesh into a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, heavy cream, sour cream, demerara sugar, flour, pumpkin pie spice, and salt; beat until smooth. Pour the pumpkin mixture into pie crusts.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
