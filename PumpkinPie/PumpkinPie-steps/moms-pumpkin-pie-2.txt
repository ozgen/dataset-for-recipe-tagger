Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix the eggs, evaporated milk and pumpkin. In a separate bowl, mix the sugar, flour, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Stir into the pumpkin mixture. Pour into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking 45 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center of the pie comes out clean. Cool on a metal rack.
