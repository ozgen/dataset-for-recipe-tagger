Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fit the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.
In a bowl, whisk the egg substitute, sucralose sweetener, sweetener with brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice until well combined. Whisk in the pumpkin puree and evaporated milk until smooth. Pour the filling into the pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until the pie filling is set in the center, about 40 minutes.
