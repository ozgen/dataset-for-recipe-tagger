In a large saucepan, combine gelatin, cornstarch, spices and salt. Stir in pumpkin and evaporated milk. Let stand for 5 minutes to soften gelatin. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture bubbles; cook and stir for 2 minutes after bubbling. Remove from heat.
In a medium bowl, gradually stir about 1 cup of cooked mixture into beaten eggs. Return to remaining mixture in saucepan and cook over low heat for 2 minutes; do not boil. Remove from heat and stir in artificial sweetener after filing has cooled to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
Pour mixture into pie crust; cover and chill for 6 hours or overnight. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
