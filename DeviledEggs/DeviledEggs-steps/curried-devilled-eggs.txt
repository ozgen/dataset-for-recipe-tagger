Hard-boiled and hard-cooked are terms used to describe the same cooking technique for eggs. For the best texture, and to prevent the yolks from discolouring during cooking, the following cooking method is recommended. Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring water to a boil. Cover the saucepan and remove it from the heat. Leave eggs in the water for 18 minutes (for large eggs). Drain water; pour cold water over eggs until they feel cool to the touch.
Cut eggs in half lengthwise. Remove yolk and place in a bowl. Set egg white halves aside.
Mash yolks with a fork; add ham, salad dressing, onion powder, curry powder and pepper. Stir together until well combined.
Fill each egg white half with about 1 tbsp of the yolk mixture. Sprinkle paprika over top. Chill until serving time.
