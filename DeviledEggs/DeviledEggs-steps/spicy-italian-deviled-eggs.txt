Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.
Slice eggs in half, and remove the yolks. Place the yolks into a medium bowl, and mix with the mustard, Italian dressing, mayonnaise, and pepper. Arrange the egg white halves on a plate, and sprinkle with salt. Spoon the yolk mixture into the egg halves, or use a pastry bag and pipe the filling in for a more professional look. Sprinkle with paprika, and refrigerate until serving.
