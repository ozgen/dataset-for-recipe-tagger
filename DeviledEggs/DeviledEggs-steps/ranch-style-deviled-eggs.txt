Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.
Cut the eggs in half lengthwise and carefully remove the yolks to a bowl. Mash the yolks with the mayonnaise and mustard and season with pepper and ranch dressing mix, blending until smooth. Spoon the mixture into the egg white halves and garnish with a sprinkle of paprika.
