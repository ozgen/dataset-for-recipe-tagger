Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork until smooth; stir in mayonnaise,  green onions, rice wine vinegar, and wasabi paste. Season with salt.
Arrange egg white halves cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into whites; garnish each egg half with pickled ginger and pea shoots.
