Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 5x9-inch loaf pan.
Mix ground beef, 1/2 cup barbeque sauce, milk, egg, bacon bits, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; stir in bread crumbs to desired consistency.
Place half the ground beef mixture into the prepared loaf pan and press an indentation into the meat mixture, leaving a 1-inch rim of meat all around the indentation.
Fill the indentation with processed cheese and top with remaining meat mixture.
Press lightly to seal.
Brush 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce over the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 60 to 80 minutes.
