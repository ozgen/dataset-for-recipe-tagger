Preheat outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Lightly oil grill grate, and place about 4 inches from heat source.
Mix the ground chicken, onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and egg together in a bowl until thoroughly blended.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Divide chicken mixture evenly and form into 4 soft patties.
Cook the chicken patties on the preheated grill until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on thickness.
To serve, place each patty on one half of a hamburger bun, top with a slice of cheese, avocado slices, and desired amounts of jalapeno peppers and salsa.
Cover with remaining half of bun.
