Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.
Drain.
Combine potato chip crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, bread crumbs, and butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Set aside.
Heat prepared white sauce, Cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese, and dry mustard in a large saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes.
Remove from heat.
Combine cooked macaroni and cheese together in a large bowl.
Spoon mixture into 4 (10-ounce) ramekins and cover with toasted potato chip topping.
