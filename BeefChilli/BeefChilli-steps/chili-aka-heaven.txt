Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the pot until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Cook and stir onions, jalapeno peppers, habanero peppers, and garlic with the ground beef until onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add chili beans, tomatoes, water, chili powder, and cumin; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 hour.
