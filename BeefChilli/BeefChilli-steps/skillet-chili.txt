Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain excess fat, and crumble. Stir in onion, green pepper, tomato sauce, tomato paste and chili beans. Season with chili powder, hot sauce, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and garlic powder.
Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until desired consistency (at least 1 hour for best flavor).
