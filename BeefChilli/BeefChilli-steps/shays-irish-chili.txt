Heat the oil in a soup pot set over medium heat. Add the ground beef, garlic, and onion. Cook, stirring to crumble the ground beef, until beef is no longer pink. Drain off any excess grease. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, beef bouillon, and chili powder. Add the sugar, tomatoes, light and dark kidney beans and potatoes. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
