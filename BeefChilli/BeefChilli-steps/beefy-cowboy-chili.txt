Sprinkle steak pieces evenly with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in 6-quart saucepan over medium-high heat 1 minute. Add steak pieces, onion, garlic and chili powder. Cook 5 minutes, or until steak is browned on all sides and onion is tender, stirring frequently.
Add beans, both diced tomatoes with their juice, tomato paste, water, sugar and red pepper; blend well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve with optional toppings, if desired.
