Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green bell pepper, orange bell pepper, onion, and celery. Cook until tender. Place pork and beef in the pot, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease.
Mix serrano chile peppers, diced tomatoes, green chile peppers, tomato paste, kidney beans, garlic, lime juice, tequila, and beer into the pot. Season with chili powder, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 hours.
