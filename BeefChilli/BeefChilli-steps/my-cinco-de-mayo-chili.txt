Heat a large stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and pork in the pot until completely browned, about 10 minutes. Drain as much grease from the meat mixture as you can and return pot to heat.
Stir sweet onions, green onions, and garlic through the meat mixture; cook and stir until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir tomatoes, beer, chili powder, cumin, chile peppers, corn meal, ancho chile pepper, tequila, jalapeno pepper, cocoa powder, and salt into the meat mixture. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the tomatoes are dissolving into the liquid, 1 to 2 hours. Stir corn and black beans into the chili; continue cooking until hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
