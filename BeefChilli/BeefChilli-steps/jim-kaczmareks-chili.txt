Place meat in freezer until slightly frozen.  Cut into 1/4 to 1/2 inch cubes.
In a large skillet over medium heat, brown meat until it turns gray.  Stir in onions and garlic.  Cook until onions are tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.
Cut up canned tomatoes, reserving juice; combine in a 6 quart cooking pot with tomato sauce, beer, chili powder, oregano, paprika, cumin, brown sugar, beef base, bay leaves, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a slow boil over high heat.  Add meat mixture, and reduce heat to low.  Simmer, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours.
Mix in pinto beans.  Simmer for 1/2 hour longer.  Taste, and adjust seasonings if desired.
