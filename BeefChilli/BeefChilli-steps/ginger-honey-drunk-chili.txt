Heat bacon drippings in a heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir carrot in the hot drippings for about 3 minutes.
Stir the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, and onion with the carrot; cook and stir until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in garlic and beef; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease from the pot.
Stir tomato paste and tomato sauce into the beef mixture. Increase heat to medium-high heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Pour in dark beer, tequila, and chicken broth; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in chili powder, paprika, cumin, coriander, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, white pepper, and honey. Simmer for 45 minutes to 2 hours.
Stir grated ginger into the chili about 15 minutes before serving.
