In a large saucepan or stockpot, cook ground beef, onion and red pepper until beef is browned. Drain off excess fat.
Stir in the chili powder, garlic, bay leaf, diced tomatoes, spaghetti sauce, salsa and taco sauce. Lower heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Stir in beans just before serving and heat through.
