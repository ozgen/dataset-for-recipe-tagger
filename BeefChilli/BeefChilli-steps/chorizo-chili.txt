Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef and chorizo sausage into onion mixture; cook, breaking meat apart while stirring, until no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix ground beef-chorizo mixture, diced tomatoes, chili, butter beans, tomato sauce, chili powder, chipotle seasoning blend, salt, and black pepper in a slow cooker.
Cook on High until flavors have blended, 3 to 4 hours.
