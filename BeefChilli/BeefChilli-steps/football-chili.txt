Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot stockpot until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Add green bell pepper and onion to ground beef; saute until vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir tomato juice, mild chili beans, hot chili beans, beer, chili powder, garlic salt, vinegar, allspice, red pepper flakes, and bay leaves into ground beef mixture. Cover stockpot with a lid and simmer at least 2 hours.
