Place ground beef into a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook the beef until it begins to lose its pink color, about 8 minutes, breaking the meat up into crumbles as it cooks; stir in celery, red bell pepper, and onion. Continue to cook until the beef is browned, about 8 more minutes. Drain excess fat.
Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato juice, water, chili powder, brown sugar, and beef bouillon cubes; cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the macaroni, and continue simmering until the pasta is tender, 10 to 15 more minutes.
