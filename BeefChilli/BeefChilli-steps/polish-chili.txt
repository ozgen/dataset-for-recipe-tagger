Place the ground beef into a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until beef is no longer pink. Drain off excess grease, leaving just enough to coat the bottom of the pot. Add the polish sausage, onion and garlic to the pot; cook and stir until onion is tender. Mix in the Anaheim, yellow and jalapeno peppers, tomatoes and tomatillos. Simmer over medium heat for about 20 minutes.
Pour in the vinegar, tomato sauce and pimentos and then mix in the pinto beans and kidney beans; cover and simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes.
