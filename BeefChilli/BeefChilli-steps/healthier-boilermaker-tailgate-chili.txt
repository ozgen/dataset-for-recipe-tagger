Pour in chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Add onion, celery, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, chile peppers, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, ground pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for at least 2 hours.
Taste and adjust salt, ground pepper, and chili powder in necessary, after 2 hours. Ladle into bowls and top with baked tortilla chips to serve.
