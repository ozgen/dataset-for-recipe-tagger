Cook and stir ground beef in a large soup pot over medium heat until meat is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Pour kidney beans, beef bouillon, plum tomatoes, tomato puree, beer, and Worcestershire sauce into beef. Stir in dry onion soup mix, red pepper flakes, dried chipotle pepper, cumin, thyme, and oregano.
Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
