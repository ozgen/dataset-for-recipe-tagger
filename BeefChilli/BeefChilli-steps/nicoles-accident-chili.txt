In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef and cook the onion until tender. Drain grease.
In a pot, mix the beef and onion, beans, vegetable juice, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and tomatoes. Season with salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
