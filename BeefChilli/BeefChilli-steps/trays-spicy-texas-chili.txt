Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, half the onion, habanero pepper, jalapeno pepper, and garlic in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Transfer beef mixture to a large pot and add tomato sauce, kidney beans, diced tomatoes with green chiles, 2 tablespoons chili powder, 1 tablespoon cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, white pepper, and black pepper.
Bring beef mixture to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in beer, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Continue to simmer chili until flavors blend, about 2 hours.
Spoon chili into bowls and top with Cheddar cheese, crackers, and remaining half onion.
