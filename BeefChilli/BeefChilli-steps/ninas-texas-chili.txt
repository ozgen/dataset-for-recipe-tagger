Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the steak, sausage, onion, green pepper, red, pepper, yellow pepper, and garlic in the pot until the onions and peppers are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken bouillon, honey, and kidney beans; bring to a boil. One at a time, stir in the cayenne pepper, chili powder, oregano, black pepper, salt, and sugar. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese into the chili in small batches and stir to melt. Reduce heat to low and slow cook about 2 hours. Thicken by stirring the masa through the chili, and simmering for 10 minutes.
