In a large saucepan over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes, or until browned. Stir in the onion and green bell pepper and saute for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Next, add the beans, mushrooms, brown sugar and chili powder to taste. Mix together well, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes to 1 hour or more, depending on how much time you have and how thick you like your chili.
