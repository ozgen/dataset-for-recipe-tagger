Brown the ground beef in a large soup pot over medium-high heat until cooked and crumbly; drain and set aside. Brown sausages, then set aside. Reduce heat to medium and stir in bacon. Cook until the bacon has released its fat and is beginning to turn crispy. Stir in garlic and onions, and cook until the onions soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste to coat the onions.
Pour in beef broth, diced tomatoes, chili beans, and pinto beans. Add the Anaheim peppers, jalapeno peppers, and serrano peppers. Season with Worcestershire, brown sugar, chipotle powder, and cumin. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 2 hours, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then simmer for 5 additional minutes before serving.
